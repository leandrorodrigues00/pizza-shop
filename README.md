## üë©‚Äçüíª About the project

This system acts as a control panel for restaurant owners who integrate their establishments with delivery apps such as iFood/Uber Eats. In this dashboard, you can monitor various essential metrics for the business, such as monthly sales, daily sales, among others. In addition, it offers the possibility of detailed monitoring of each order, displaying information such as the items sold, allowing the status of the order to be changed, as well as the option to cancel, providing greater control and efficiency in the management of the establishment.

This project applies the concepts of communication with APIs via HTTP requests and end-to-end tests (MSW, PlayWright) and unit tests (Vitest, testing-library-react, HappyDOM).

**Note:** To use the application, run both the server and the web app. Install the API by following the steps in this repository: [Pizza Shop API](https://github.com/leandrorodrigues00/pizzashop-api).
